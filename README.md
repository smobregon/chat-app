# Chat App

In my Complete Node.js Developer course by Andrew Mead I created and deployed my own chat application. 

<ol>
<li>First, navigate to <link>https://obregon-chat-app.herokuapp.com/</link>.</li>
<li>Next, you are prompted to enter a name and chat room.</li>
<li>Finally, share this link with friends!</li> 
</ol>

Once you join the same chat room you can communicate with others in real time or choose to share your location.
