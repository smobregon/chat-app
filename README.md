# Chat App

In my Complete Node.js Developer course by Andrew Mead I created and deployed my own chat application. 

1. First, navigate to [Chat App](https://obregon-chat-app.herokuapp.com/).
2. Next, you are prompted to enter a name and chat room.
3. Finally, share this link with friends!

Once you join the same chat room you can communicate with others in real time or choose to share your location.
